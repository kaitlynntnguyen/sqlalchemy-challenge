## Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data
In this section, I use Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of my climate database in the following stepd 

1. Use the SQLAlchemy `create_engine()` function to connect to my SQLite database

2. Use the SQLAlchemy `automap_base()` function to reflect tables into classes, and then save references to the classes named `station` and `measurement`.

3. Link Python to the database by creating a SQLAlchemy session.

4. Perform a precipitation analysis and a station analysis
   
   Precipitation Analysis
      1. Find the most recent date in the dataset.
      2. Using that date, get the previous 12 months of precipitation data by querying the previous 12 months of data.
      3. Select only the "date" and "prcp" values.
      4. Load the query results into a Pandas DataFrame. Explicitly set the column names.
      5. Sort the DataFrame values by "date".
      6. Plot the results by using the DataFrame `plot` method.
      7. Use Pandas to print the summary statistics for the precipitation data.
   Station Analysis
      1. Design a query to calculate the total number of stations in the dataset.
      2. Design a query to find the most-active stations (that is, the stations that have the most rows).
      3. Design a query that calculates the lowest, highest, and average temperatures that filters on the most-active station id found in the previous query.
      4. Design a query to get the previous 12 months of temperature observation (TOBS) data.


Part 2: Design Your Climate App
In this section, I designed a Flask API based on the queries that you just developed.

These are the following routes: 
   1. `/`
      - Start at the homepage. 
      - List all the available routes.
      
   2. `/api/v1.0/precipitation`
      - Convert the query results from your precipitation analysis (i.e. retrieve only the last 12 months of data) to a dictionary using `date` as the key and `prcp` as the value.
      - Return the JSON representation of your dictionary.

   3. `/api/v1.0/stations`
      - Return a JSON list of stations from the dataset.
      
   4. `/api/v1.0/tobs`
      - Query the dates and temperature observations of the most-active station for the previous year of data.
      - Return a JSON list of temperature observations for the previous year.

   5. `/api/v1.0/<start>` and `/api/v1.0/<start>/<end>`
      - Return a JSON list of the minimum temperature, the average temperature, and the maximum temperature for a specified start or start-end range.
      - For a specified start, calculate `TMIN`, `TAVG`, and `TMAX` for all the dates greater than or equal to the start date.
      - For a specified start date and end date, calculate `TMIN`, `TAVG`, and `TMAX` for the dates from the start date to the end date, inclusive.
